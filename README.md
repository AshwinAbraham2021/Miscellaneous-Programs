# Miscellaneous Programs

This repository contains some miscellaneous programs that I have written in my spare time.
Most of these programs were written in my First Semester or the beginning of my Second Semester.

These programs are usually self contained (spanning not more than 2 or 3 files).
I usually write such programs either in response to a problem given to me or when I suddenly get an idea
to code a solution to some problem.
