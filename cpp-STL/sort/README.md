# Sorting Algorithms

This file compiles some common sorting algorithms along with a few that search sorted arrays.

## Usage Instructions
Add ```sort.h``` to the directory in which your code is and include it in your code (```#include "sort.h"```).

While compiling your code, don't forget to link ```sort.cpp``` as well! (For example, ```g++ your_code.cpp sort.cpp```).
