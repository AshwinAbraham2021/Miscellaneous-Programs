# Sorting Algorithms

This file compiles some common sorting algorithms along with a few that search sorted arrays.

## Usage Instructions
Add <code> sort.h </code> to the directory in which your code is and include it in your code (<code> #include "sort.h" </code>).

While compiling your code, don't forget to link <code> sort.cpp </code> as well! (For example, <code> g++ your_code.cpp sort.cpp </code>).
